                The world is now covered in a web of internet-assisted learning programs, where you can find everything you need in seconds. They get to have degrees and diplomas in a few clicks. In such a world, we feel that it is important to make the fruits of education and social responsibility available by using a more impactful tool; performance. One of the world’s oldest texts, Naatyashastra written by the legendary sage, Bharata talks about how every performance has scientific dimensions and how the spectator plays just an important role such as the performer.
